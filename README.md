# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This social network web application using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM. MongoDB is chosen for its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data, making it a popular choice for social networks. You'll use Express.js for routing, MongoDB for database storage, and Mongoose for data modeling and manipulation. No seed data is provided, so you'll need to create your own data using Insomnia after building your API.
